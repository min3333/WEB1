        <h2>CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>
        <p>Dependent sheets or cascading style sheets (CSSs) are mainly used in [1], HTML, and XHTML, which describe how markup languages are actually presented, and can also be used in XML. It is the standard of W3C and has a high degree of freedom in defining layout and style. If Markup Language (ex. HTML) is responsible for the body of a website, CSS is responsible for decorating such as clothing and accessories. That is, if you leave the HTML structure intact and just change the CSS file, you can decorate it like a completely different website. In the case of CSS3, which is currently being developed, features such as shadow effects, gradations, and variations have been added to replace images produced by graphic editing programs. Various animation features have also been added to replace Adobe Flash to some extent.</p>
